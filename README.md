# What is this repo ?

This repository contains a simple turn-based game project made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## A challenge above all

This project is first and foremost a challenge given to me by a coder friend.

## The statement
Create a turn-based fighting game in JavaScript

User stories
 - The player arrives on the homepage, enters their name, and must click a button to start a game. (No redirection, only JavaScript)
 - The game's style is reminiscent of space cowboys.
 - Somewhere on the page, there is a round counter.
 - Rounds continue until the player dies (the goal of the game is to survive as long as possible).

Round flow
 - An enemy appears to the player as a JPG image. Its name and HP are displayed below.
 - The player can choose to attack an enemy (random damage) or heal (random healing).
 - Surviving enemies attack the player.
 - The next turn begins if the player is still alive.

Warning: Each turn, undefeated enemies remain and their HP is added to the total.

Game over
 - When the player dies, a game over screen appears displaying their score and a button to restart.

# Conclusion and credits

I created this game with the limited knowledge I have to understand the basic concepts. 
This experience allowed me to greatly improve and gain confidence in my coding abilities.
